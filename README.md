# Momentum Dev Challenge

## NOTES
* employeeData - Is setup once and not changed during processing, it is set inside the views/Home.vue component as is acting as input only.
* processing only happens inside the components/EmployeeGrid.vue component. This is where the calculation of the data items for each emplyee is happening.
* Recursive display occurs inside the components/EmployeeItem.vue component for each calculated row item
* If there is anything else please let me know through the agent, kind Regards
